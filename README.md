# Book Tracker
Book Tracker is a web app that keeps track of all the books you have read. This app is meant to be a replacement to the spreadsheet I have been using to record all the fiction books I have read since 2008. I wanted to create something with a clean and easy-to-use user interface that would allow me to not only record the books I have read, but also analyze my reading habits across the past decade. 

Users can input the title of the book, the author, year read, year published, number of pages, and indicate whether they read the book for class or if the book is a reread. Additionally, users can sort their list of books several different ways and view data analytics of their reading habits.

The app uses a variation of the LAMP stack, consisting of Mac OS, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. On the front end, jQuery/ JS with AJAX is used, along with HTML/CSS.
