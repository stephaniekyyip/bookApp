# Book Tracker
Book Tracker is a CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) web application that keeps track of all the books you have read. 

Users can input the title of the book, the author, year read, year published, number of pages, and indicate whether they read the book for class or if the book is a reread. Additionally, users can sort their list of books several different ways and view data analytics of their reading habits.

It uses the MAMP stack (Mac OS, Apache, MySQL, PHP), as well as JQuery.
